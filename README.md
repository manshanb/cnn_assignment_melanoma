## General Information
- This project builds a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. 
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- Business problem solved: accurately detect melanoma by Classification of images
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Overfitting of model is improved after class rebalancing using agumentor
- Accuracy and Loss metrics for both Traning and Validation dataset are consistent with 30 epochs.
